1: So there's this fella with a parrot. And this parrot swears
2: like a sailor, I mean he's a pistol. He can swear for five minutes
3: straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns
4: him is a quiet, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is
5: driving him crazy.
6: 
7: One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the bird by the
8: throat, shakes him really hard, and yells, "QUIT IT!" But this just
9: makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever.
10: 
11: Then the guy gets mad and says, "OK, fork you." and locks the bird
12: in a kitchen cabinet.
13: 
14: This really aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches,
15: and when the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a
16: stream of invective that would make a veteran sailor blush.
17: 
18: At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the
19: freezer.
20: 
21: For the first few seconds there is a terrible din. The bird kicks
22: and claws and thrashes. Then it suddenly gets _very_ quiet.
23: 
24: At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the
25: bird may be hurt. After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so
26: worried that he opens up the freezer door.
27: 
28: The bird calmly climbs onto the man's out-stretched arm and says,
29: "Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you. I'll do my best to
30: improve my vocabulary from now on."
31: 
32: The man is astounded. He can't understand the transformation that
33: has come over the parrot.
34: 
35: Then the parrot says, "By the way, what did the chicken do?"
36:
